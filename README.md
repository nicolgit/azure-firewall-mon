Azure-Firewall-mon provides an _alternative_and_opinable_ ðŸ˜Š way to access and inpsect Azure Firewall logs. The recommended approach for analyze Azure Firewall logs is to set up a Log Analytics Workspace where you collect all the data and use Kusto queries to check what's happening. 

In Azure-Firewall-mon the idea is to provide an approach much more like SysInternal's Process Monitor or Check Point's SmartView where no queries or dashboard need to be prepared, but all events are available as a log stream. A full-text search at the top of the page allows you to quickly filter the content displayed on the screen, helping you to understand what is happening right now (or almost).

# Setup 

![architecture](images/architecture.png)

Azure-Firewall-mon is an open source, [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), written in [Angular](https://angular.io/). 

> If you don't want to install it in your environment, you can already use latest build deployed and available at <https://az-firewall-mon.azurewebsites.net/>. 

To use this app with **YOUR data**, you must perform the following steps on your Azure Subscription:

1. Create an Azure Event Hub Namespace
2. Create an Azure Event Hub inside the namespace, with a `1-day retention`
3. Create a Shared Access Policy, with  _Listen_ claim
4. Open the Azure Firewall instance you want to monitor, go to Monitoring > Diagnostic Settings > Add Diagnostic Settings: 

    - Select _all_ _logs_ and "Stream to Event Hub"
    - Select the Event Hub Namespace and Hub created above
    - click `SAVE`

Now, open <https://az-firewall-mon.azurewebsites.net/> and copy in the `Event Hub Connection String` field the connection string of the Shared Access Policy created above, and click on `Let's begin`.

# More Information

[Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/overview) (AF) is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.

[Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview) helps you maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services. It delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. 

AF is integrated with Azure Monitor. This means you can forward AF metrics and logs to:
* Log Analytics Workspace
* Azure Storage
* Event hub

A [Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview) is a unique environment for log data from Azure Monitor and other Azure services. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration but might combine data from multiple services.

Ingest data in a Log Analytics workspace has a Latency.

Latency refers to the time that data is created on the monitored system and the time that it comes available for analysis in Azure Monitor. 

The [Kusto](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) Query Language is a  tool to explore your data in a Log Analytics Workspace. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQL's: databases, tables, and columns.
